# weatherVSlatitude

## We take 500+ random cities and see the impact of latitude on various factors using OpenWeatherMap API

#### Sample run : 500+ Cities selected

## Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
### Strong correlation as seen from the below plots. Closer to the latitude sees higher temperatures.

-Scatter plot below shows the rise in temperature as the location in question gets closer to the equator

-Binned average temperature plot by latitude shows the same trend more clearly




## Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
### No real corelation between Humidity vs Latitude

-Humidity depends on additional factors rather than just latitude of the location


Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude

Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
